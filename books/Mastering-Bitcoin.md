## Review

This book is a good introduction to the Bitcoin world, and the underline technologies. Since 2011 the world as changed with the Satoshi Nakamoto paper, describing the components of the Bitcoin protocol, as a digital currency. Among these components are the blockchain (distributed ledger built on a consensus technique in a distributed environment, addressing the 2 Ottoman Generals problems, as well the concept of mining), the transactions (and how confidentiality is achieved), network architecture (relying on a P2P network), the security and the alternative currencies and blockchains.

The Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, how was the first solving the 4 major currency problems: durability, divisibility, transportability, and noncounterfeitability. Until then, all the attempts of creating cryptocurrencies failed, since all the money characteristic werenâ€™t achieved.

The author explains start to explain the Bitcoin client, and all the concepts of a bitcoin wallet, the security associated with it (Public Key Cryptography) and how an address is generated. He leads us through the operations in a Bitcoin Wallet, such as backup/restore, decoding transactions, among others. Explains as well the concept of blocks (later detailed in the blockchain), and how a transaction is added to a block.

The Public Key Cryptography is explained in detail, including the Elliptic Curve Cryptography, used in the Bitcoin algorithms. Presents the Bitcoin Addresses schemes, including the standards for Pay-to-Script Hash and Multi-Sig Addresses, useful in a corporate world.

Detail the Bitcoin Network, its typology (P2P) and the consensus algorithm among the peers. The blocks are created based on a proof-of-work method, where a node aggregates a number of transactions, and try to generate the proper SHA256 hash above the proof-of-work target. The first node achieving it (on average in 10 minutes) broadcast the result to the network and the peers acknowledge it. Describes the method when collisions exist, and how the peers resolve the dispute (using the most value proof-of-work). Also how the network adjusts to achieve the target of 10 minutes to mining a new block, since every time that a node joins (or leaves) the computation power is affected.

Addresses alternative chains and currencies, point out the main benefits and use cases for them. The technology is in its infancy; however, we can see multiple applications of it in the next upcoming years. In the later chapter addresses Security, how the root of trust works, as well different security best practices, such as physical Bitcoin Storage, Hardware Wallets, or Multi-Sig and Governance.

This book is a must read since explores all the aspects of the Bitcoin Protocol. The author is considered by its peer as one of the lead academics in this field of study, and the protocol successfully implements a distributed system in a secure fashion. For the info security community, this is an important starting point since in the upcoming years we will have more challenges to manage the security of the organizations, since the technology is shifting to embrace the new proven technologies, and apply it to different industries and domains, such as Finance or Identity Management.
